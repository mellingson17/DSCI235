# DSCI 235 Final Project
Soccer, known as football to the majority of people, is the most popular sport in the world. Nearly all countries have a national team. Fans are drawn to major competitions such as the FIFA World Cup and the Olympics, as well as many smaller competitions throughout the year and international friendly games. The dataset I have selected includes results and other information on international football matches from 1872 to 2021. There are over 40,000 recorded games over this time span. The sheer size of the dataset provides slight challenges in visualizing certain aspects of the data.

With this data, I intend to answer the following questions:

1. Is there an advantage to playing on a home field or being the home team?
2. Does success in international friendlies predict success in tournaments?
3. Are there teams that are consistently successful over time?
4. What countries host the most international matches?
